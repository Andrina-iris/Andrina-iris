### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a computer vision project on film analysis, and will start on project on Geophysics data analysis again soon
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning signal processing!
- ğŸ”± I'm a 3rd year Machine Learning & Neural Computation (Cognitive Science) student with a double-major in Interdisciplinary Computing Arts & Music, with a minor in Computer Science & Engineering, at UC San Diego. I'll graduate in June 2024.
- ğŸ’¬ How to reach me: I'll reply DMs / give out my resumÃ© and personal contact on LinkedIn. https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrina-zhang/ (Open web doesn't seem very safe to me regarding to my personal infoğŸ¤£)
- âš¡ Fun fact: I did some marketing internship simultaneously with my first year of college, which I had to take it remotely, because I ran two fan clubs when I was in high school <3
